I regularly find myself with a dilemma.

I want a space on the web that I own & control, but I don't have the time or inclination to 'blog' in the traditional sense. I do however want somewhere to save some ramblings, link lists and other information that I'd like others to be able to read.

My next step is therefore to create this simple static site hosted on GitHub and slowly move across the more interesting (useful) content I've written.

Bear with me. And find out more about me [here][/about].
